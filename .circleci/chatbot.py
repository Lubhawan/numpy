I am using langgraph and passing whole message history to it each time invoked by user in streamlit and only returning response back to it, in langgraph flow whenever tool call happens i want to save an excel as result and display the download button in streamlit ui below the response for downloading the excel.

Do i need to return some variable back to streamlit for defining the excel has been saved with path for download button display?

how should i do it?
